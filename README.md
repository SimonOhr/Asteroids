# Asteroids
Asteroids was my first ever coding experience, this repo is that project redone at the end of my first year, its not pretty, but it is miles above its predecessor.
*Edit, well past my first year now, rediscovered this project and decided to put some more work into it, just for fun.

Well, it has sentimental value. As a remake of my first school assignment, it represents the progress made, so far.
However, I don't have the time to sink into personal projects whilst not on semester.

I have a vague idea of what I want to create with it. It won't be of AAA standard for sure. But I'm thinking decent sized world, populated with asteroids, pirates, maybe friendly npcs.
If I ever get around to it I wanna make it an rpg experience, leveling up/ upgrading your ship, new/more guns, bigger ship, some shield effects.
I would also like to tie up the progression with some kind of economy, I have space stations in mind, and zones of control with turrets and pirate invasions.
All leading up to beating some boss charater(s)
Thats the basic idea. I would like to spend some time with the architeture and implementation of the AI(when I get to that point) as I find AI to be both challanging and really interesting, good combo!
